                    <p>
                        Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some
                        arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf
                        Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small
                        airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller
                        planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the
                        airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
                        island within the next few years.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ground Transportation</h3>
                    <ul>

                            Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m.
                            to 11 p.m. every day.
                        </li>

                        <li>Private buses serve the rest of the island.</li>
                        <li>
                            Taxis are available in Taniti City Rental cars can
                            be rented from a local rental agency near the
                            airport.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <p>
                        Taniti City is flat and very walkable. Many tourists
                        stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area
                        is easy to explore on foot.
